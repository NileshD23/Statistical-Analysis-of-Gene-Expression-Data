Part 1: Understanding the Breast Cancer Study
---------------------------------------------
a) The first study was on epigenetic portraits of human breast cancers. The purpose of this study was to 
   understand the diversity of the heterogenous group of breast cancer disorders. This was done by using
   the Infinium Methylation Platform to profile at single-CpG resolution the methylomes of 119 breast tumors.
   The second study was on deep sequence analysis of the relationship between gene expression, CpG island 
   methylation, and gene copy number in breast cancer cells. This was done by using deep sequence technology 
   to profile the transcriptome, gene copy number, and CpG island methylation status simultaneously in eight
   commonly used breast cell lines to develop a model for how these genomic features are integrated in estrogen
   receptor positive and negative breast cancer. 

b) The first study had 90 gene expression samples. The second study had 24 gene expression samples. 

c) In the first study, they used 92 gene expression profiling in breast cancer patients. Methylation was linked
   to gene expression. In the second study, sequences were mapped to the human genome to obtain digitized gene 
   expression data, DNA copy number in reference to the non-tumor cell line, and methylation status of 21,570 CpG
   islands to identify differentially expressed genes that were correlated with methylation or copy number changes.      



Part 3: Statistical Analysis of Microarray Gene Expression Data
----------------------------------------------------------------
d)	The p-value is the probability of obtaining results at leas as exreme as teh oberved reslt of a statistical
	  hypothesis test. From the bell curved t-stat graph on the PDF, we can see that the area on both sides of the
	  bell comprises of the area of the p-value. In R, when we calculate pval = pt(-abs(tstat) ,N-2), we are taking
  	the absolute value, which only covers one side. This is great for a one-sided test. If we want to compute the 
  	p-value for a two-sided test, we just have to multiply by 2: pval = 2 * pt(-abs(tstat) ,N-2)

e-ii -> iv) For some reason I keep getting 17,570

e-v)  RAX2 (Retina And Anterior Neural Fold Homeobox 2) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with RAX2 include Cone-Rod             Dystrophy 11 and Macular Degeneration, Age-Related, 6. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include sequence            -specific DNA binding. An important paralog of this gene is RAX.
